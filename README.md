# Fine Voicing

Fine Voicing is a tool to generate conversations with voice assistants, like OpenAI or Ultravox.

Features:
- Generate conversations with a voice assistant, using text (TTS WIP).
- Evaluate the conversation accuracy.
- Evaluate the extracted information.

It relies on [CrewAI](https://www.crewai.com/) to manage the agents and tasks.

## Installation

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```bash
python src/main.py
```

## Test Case

Each test case is defined in a JSON file in the `test-cases` directory.
To add a new test case, create a new JSON file in the `test-cases` directory.

Use the `test-cases/test.example.json` as a template.

```json
{
    "voice_model": {
        "provider": "openai",
        "model": "realtime",
        "voice": "alloy",
        "api_key": "your_api_key_here"
    },
    "instructions": "You're an helpful assistant speaking with a human being or an AI assistant",
    "test_mode": "text", // text or tts
    "turns": 1 // number of conversation turns to be generated
}
```

## Test Results

The test execution logs are written in the `logs` folder, in files named as `test-result_{test_case_name}_{timestamp}.log`. 

Note that all the information logged in the conversation were generated by the models, and are not based on any personal information.

## Configuration
TODO

## Agents

Two agents are involved:
- Conversation Voice Simulation Agent: In charge of generating each side of the conversation, based on the roles derived from the test case instructions, and the conversation history.
- Conversation Moderator Agent: In charge of evaluating the conversation and deciding if the conversation should continue or terminate.

## Roadmap

- Add support for [Ultravox](https://www.ultravox.ai/), an open-weight speech-to-speech model.
- Enable to run the tests using real human voice instead of generated text/TTS.
- Automate the turn management (currently hardcoded in the test definition).
- Explore a more agentic design.
